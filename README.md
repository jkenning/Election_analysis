# Election Analysis



## Overview of Project

This analysis scenario involves assisting a board of elections employee named Tom, for an election audit of the results of a U.S. congressional district in Colorado. The task involves reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and to confirm the winner of the election based on the popular vote. Three main voting methods will be taken into account which will determine the outcome of the results:

- Mail-in ballots
- Punch cards
- Direct Recording Electronic voting machines

### Purpose

While this analysis could be performed in Excel, the goal is to determine if there is a way to automate the process using Python. If successful, this code could therefore be used to audit senatorial races and local elections in addition to other congressional districts. 

## Data Preparation

1. Imported data and checked if it is readable

2. Created a roadmap for sequential steps in the analysis using psuedocode

3.
